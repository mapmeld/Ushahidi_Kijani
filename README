==KIJANI extension to Ushahidi==
"Kijani" - the Swahili word for green - is an environmental tool based on Ushahidi, a crisis mapping program for collecting information from citizen reporters.

In this 0.1 release, Kijani is inter-operable with any Ushahidi or Crowdmap instance.
* On your own map, you can add Kijani as a plugin and make it available to all users
* When you visit a non-Kijani map, such as http://kettleman.crowdmap.com , you can add Kijani in your web browser (bookmarklets)
* You can also set Kijani to add itself automatically (user scripts)

Why work around Ushahidi plugins?
* Volunteer coordinators can develop and activate tools and information-sharing without adding work for admins.
* Visitors can add information from other sources to the map, on equal footing with reports selected by the admin. 
* Admins may be forced offline (such as in Egypt) while news continues to be reported, and information on the ground changes rapidly.
* CrowdMap's support for plugins is limited.
* A response group can host their own layers and geoprocessing tools, and connect them to Ushahidi reports, without traffic from all public users.
* A response group can view sensors, cameras, or other sensitive data to their own map, without making those reports and locations public.

WELCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Thanks for using Ushahidi. We hope that you find the setup and installation process as smooth as possible. We have an active community so if you get stuck along the way, head over to the forums (http://forums.ushahidi.com/) and get some help. In addition to the forums, we have a wiki (http://wiki.ushahidi.com/doku.php) with more detailed information about the platform.


System Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A server with Unicode support.
- MySQL version 5.0 or greater.
- PHP version 5.2.3 or greater.
- An HTTP Server. Kohana which Ushahidi is built upon is known to work with the following web servers: Apache 1.3+, Apache2.0+, lighttpd, and MS IIS.


Required Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The follwing is a list of PHP extensions that must be installed on your server in order for Ushahidi to run properly.
- PCRE (http://php.net/pcre) must be compiled with –enable-utf8 and –enable-unicode-properties for UTF-8 functions to work properly.
- iconv (http://php.net/iconv) is required for UTF-8 transliteration.
- mcrypt (http://php.net/mcrypt) is required for encryption.
- SPL (http://php.net/spl) is required for several core libraries
- mbstring (http://php.net/mbstring) which speeds up Kohana's UTF-8 functions.
- cURL (http://php.net/curl) which is used to access remote sites.
- MySQL (http://php.net/mysql) is required for database access.

* Need to figure out what extensions you already have installed on your server? Here are instructions to do just that: http://jontangerine.com/silo/php/phpinfo/


Preliminary Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing Ushahidi you will need to give your server authority to write to certian files and folders. Please make sure the following files and folders are writable by your server:
- application/config/config.php
- application/config
- application/cache
- application/logs
- media/uploads
- .htaccess

* The process of configuring file permissions is different for various operating systems. Here are some helpful links about permissions for the Windows (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419) and Unix (http://www.washington.edu/computing/unix/permissions.html) operating systems.


Installation Guide
